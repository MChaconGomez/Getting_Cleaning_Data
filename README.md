# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This repository of course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 


## Files

* Codebook.md --> describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data
* run_analysis.R --> script for performing the analysis
* tidy_data.txt --> the final data.

### Description of the data preparation :
In this part we describes how we had preparing the data:

1- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2- Extracts only the measuresments on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
